# Introduction to Machine Learning

Using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze data sets.

## Analyze a Data Set:

The data set concerns housing values in suburbs of Boston. You can find more [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing)

### Attribute Information:

1. CRIM: per capita crime rate by town 
2. ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. 
3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town 
4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) 
5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) 
6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling 
7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 
8. DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres 
9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways 
10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 
11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 
12. B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 
13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population 
14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

### Analysis:

- The median and average home values across all Boston Suburbs in dollars.
- The median home value of the suburb with the newest houses.
- The relationship between per-capita crime rate and the pupil-teacher ratio. Differentiate between whether or not the suburb is bounded by the Charles River.
- The relationship between the proportion of black citizens and the distance to employment centers in Boston.
- The relationship between median value of owner-occuped homes and nitric oxide concentration along with median home value and the proportion of non-retail business (on the same plot).
- The full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000 in suburbs with the most newest constructions vs in suburbs with most older houses
